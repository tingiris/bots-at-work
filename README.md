Bots at Work
---
Ideas and stuff relating to the roles and applications for bots and digital assistants in business.

## Introduction
Today, a ten-person company can accomplish what might have taken 100 people just 10 years ago. Ten years from now (perhaps less) one person might be able to accomplish what requires 100 people today. This isn't a stretch to imagine, especially as artificially intelligent bots and digital assistants start playing bigger roles in the workplace.

Imagine it, a billion dollar company with only ten employees. Or, how about a ten billion dollar company with ten employees? Will emerging technologies make this possible or even commonplace in the years to come?  Could a substantial company with millions of customers and billions in revenue be run almost exclusively by bots and digital assistants? I believe so.
