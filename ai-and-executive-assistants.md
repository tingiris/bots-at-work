## Brainstorm

- How do we identify what can be automated?
    - Reasoning tasks vs process tasks
    - Is the task human-to-human?
    - Is emotion necessary
    - Is it transactional in nature?
    - Can it be done with automation?
    - Can it be managed with automation?
    - Are human components fungible?
- It's not about the limitations of today's technology. It's about the possibilities for today's technology in near future.
- If text messages only got delivered 50% of the time would you use it?
- Technology barriers of adoption: cost, complexity, capability


## Decision Tree

1. Is the work fungible?
2. Can the work be automated?
3. Is automating the work costly?
4. Will automation provide a clear ROI?
5. Is the work customer facing?
6. Will automation improve the customer expierance?
